# Analysis on Typical Elements of Movies on Netflix

A quick analysis on the typical elements of movies from various genres based on the "Netflix Movies and TV Shows" dataset on Kaggle, the main visualization tool that I used back then was InfraNodus. It is more useful than Word Cloud when you want to explore the relationship (e.g. co-occurrence) between the words, and there is no coding skill required to use it. 

And thanks to the creator of InfraNodus @Dmitry Paranyushkin, it has been being published on InfraNodus website. Feel free to check it out if you are interested.
